NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs::MatchInstalled - Depend on versions of
    modules the same as you have installed

VERSION
    version 0.1.1

SYNOPSIS
    This is based on the code of
    "Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Author::KENTNL::Prereqs::Latest::Selective", but
    intended for a wider audience.

        [Prereqs::MatchInstalled]
        module = My::Module

    NOTE: Dependencies will only be upgraded to match the *Installed*
    version if they're found elsewhere in the dependency tree.

    This is designed so that it integrates with other automated version
    provisioning.

    If you're hard-coding module dependencies instead, you will want to
    place this module *after* other modules that declare dependencies.

    For instance:

        [Prereqs]
        Foo = 0

        [Prereqs::MatchInstalled]
        module = Foo

    ^^ "Foo" will be upgraded to the version installed.

    By default, dependencies that match values of "module" will be upgraded
    when they are found in:

        phase: build, test, runtime, configure, develop
        relation: depends, suggests, recommends

    To change this behavior, specify one or more of the following
    parameters:

        applyto_phase = build
        applyto_phase = configure

        applyto_relation = requires

    etc.

    For more complex demands, this also works:

        applyto = build.requires
        applyto = configure.recommends

    And that should hopefully be sufficient to cover any conceivable
    use-case.

    Also note, we don't do any sort of sanity checking on the module list
    you provide.

    For instance,

        module = strict
        module = warning

    Will both upgrade the strict and warnings dependencies on your module,
    regardless of how daft an idea that may be.

    And with a little glue

        module = perl

    Does what you want, but you probably shouldn't rely on that =).

METHODS
  mvp_multivalue_args
    The following properties can be specified multiple times:

    *   "applyto"

    *   "applyto_relation"

    *   "applyto_phase"

    *   "modules"

  "mvp_aliases"
    The "module" is an alias for "modules"

  "current_version_of"
        $self->current_version_of($package);

    Attempts to find the current version of $package.

    Returns "undef" if something went wrong.

  "register_prereqs"
    This is for "Dist::Zilla::Role::PrereqSource", which gets new
    prerequisites from this module.

ATTRIBUTES
  "applyto_phase"
    Determines which phases will be checked for module dependencies to
    upgrade.

        [Prereqs::MatchInstalled]
        applyto_phase = build
        applyto_phase = test

    Defaults to:

        build test runtime configure develop

  "applyto_relation"
    Determines which relations will be checked for module dependencies to
    upgrade.

        [Prereqs::MatchInstalled]
        applyto_relation = requires

    Defaults to:

        requires suggests recommends

  "applyto"
    Determines the total list of "phase"/"relation" combinations which will
    be checked for dependencies to upgrade.

    If not specified, is built from "applyto_phase" and "applyto_relation"

        [Prereqs::MatchInstalled]
        applyto = runtime.requires
        applyto = configure.requires

  "modules"
    Contains the list of modules that will be searched for in the existing
    "Prereqs" stash to upgrade.

        [Prereqs::MatchInstalled]
        module = Foo
        module = Bar
        modules = Baz ; this is the same as the previous 2

PRIVATE ATTRIBUTES
  "_applyto_list"
    Internal.

    Contains the contents of "applyto" represented as an
    "ArrayRef[ArrayRef[Str]]"

  "_modules_hash"
    Contains a copy of "modules" as a hash for easy look-up.

PRIVATE METHODS
  _build_applyto
  _build_applyto_list
  _build__modules_hash
  _user_wants_upgrade_on
